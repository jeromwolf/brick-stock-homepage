# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a newly initialized homepage project directory. As of the initial creation, the directory is empty and awaiting implementation.

## Context

This homepage project exists within a larger portfolio of projects including:
- ParseNoteLM: Full-stack app with FastAPI backend and React frontend
- flux-blockchain: Smart contract project using Solidity and Hardhat
- flux-game: Next.js gaming platform
- flux-rag: Python-based RAG system with Docker
- greatWorld: AI stock analysis platform
- kss-fresh: Knowledge sharing system with Next.js and Prisma

## Development Guidelines

When implementing the homepage:

1. **Technology Stack Selection**: Consider the existing projects' tech stacks when choosing frameworks. Most projects use:
   - Frontend: React/Next.js with TypeScript
   - Styling: Tailwind CSS
   - Backend (if needed): Python/FastAPI or Node.js

2. **Common Commands**: Once the project is initialized with a specific stack, update this section with:
   - Build commands
   - Development server commands
   - Linting and formatting commands
   - Test commands

3. **Architecture Considerations**:
   - If creating a portfolio/project showcase, consider dynamic project imports
   - If building a hub, ensure easy navigation between projects
   - Consider responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing

## Notes

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated once the technology stack is chosen and the initial project structure is established.
